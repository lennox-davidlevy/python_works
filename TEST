 1. [:!command](:!cmd) executes an external command.

     Some useful examples are:
     `:!ls`{vim}              -  shows a directory listing
     `:!rm FILENAME`{vim}     -  removes file FILENAME

 2. [:w](:w) FILENAME             writes the current Vim file to disk with
                            name FILENAME.

 3. [v](v)  motion  :w FILENAME   saves the Visually selected lines in file
                             FILENAME.

 4. [:r](:r) FILENAME             retrieves disk file FILENAME and puts it
                            below the cursor position.

 5. [:r !dir](:r!)                reads the output of the dir command and
                           puts it below the cursor position.
